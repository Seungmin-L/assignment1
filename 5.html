     <p style="text-align: justify;">﻿&nbsp; Games are changing day by day in the high-speed world of the 21st century, where technology overwhelms humans. Books containing game theory are often treated as 'old one' within only six months of publication. Like this, the pace of development of games is future-oriented. However, it is clear that there are also disadvantages to games. It can lead to addiction. More than 2 billion people around the world enjoy online video games. According to online video game addiction statistics, at least 1 per cent and up to 10 per cent of game users have obsessive-compulsive problems. It may not be able to feel the numbers if hear about only percentage. The percentage may seem small, but one per cent of the two billion people is 20 million, and 10 per cent is 200 million. Video game addiction has some negative effects. It can interfere with sleep habits, which can cause fatigue, sleepiness, or insomnia, and can affect eating habits by skipping meals frequently. I would like to help alleviate some of the game addiction symptoms by presenting creative ideas to games.</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>&nbsp; There are many different kinds of games these days. Starting with mobile games played through smartphones, there are arcade games played by machines, PC games played on CDs or DVDs containing game software, online games played by running programs stored on hard disks, and console games played by connecting consoles such as joysticks and Joypad to your TV. VR (Virtual Reality) game is also a console game. Among them, RPG (Role-Playing Game), which is part of an online game, is a role-playing game that users enjoy playing the characters in the game. MMORPG stands for Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game, which is a kind of RPG game that can be played simultaneously by multiple players online.&nbsp;</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>&nbsp; The game that I would like to suggest is a new form that combines the characteristics of MMORPG and VR game. MMORPG is also a kind of RPG, so the basic way of playing games follows RPG, and the user plays a character in the game and participates as a player. However, the number of people participating in the game is limited, and this will depend on the design of the story that the game maker makes. Each user who participates in the game must play a different character and act as an individual. Users who meet this condition run games simultaneously and connect to one server based on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth environments. With all these things are done, players wear VR machines that have added the ability to understand the rhythm of their bodies. And like other RPGs, they enjoy and digest the storylines presented in the game more vividly. The HP and additional stats of each player follow the actual state of the user. For example, a physically exhausted player in real life starts with a lower HP than any other player. Or if the user plays the game for a long time, the statistics capability such as HP or strength, agility will be significantly lower than the first time that the user starts. These are done through a biometric sensor attached to a VR machine. After getting information about the heartbeat or body rhythm through the sensor, it is reflected in the state of the character in the game. This prevents users who want to get the best results from playing games for a long time because they play the game while trying to figure out their physical condition.</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>&nbsp; This game requires most of the skills required by original RPG and VR games. First of all, unlike a typical RPG, there should be a realistic three-dimensional background. The three-dimensional spatiality required to implement virtual reality is aided by computer graphics and input/output device technology. Computer graphics technology works with three elements: resolution, modelling, and rendering. As the number of polygons that go into modelling increases, it is possible to express characters in the game and their surroundings in detail. Although it requires that high-performance Real-time computing, it is essential for users to become more immersed in their virtual environments.  Next, this game needs a solid storyline that players can play in line with the reputation of Role-playing game. And it also needs to have its own characters and their detailed settings and backgrounds. Also, because players have to be connected to a network like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to play games together, they need networking technology and servers to connect based on that network connection.</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>&nbsp; Furthermore, this game requires a lot of equipment. To perfectly synchronize the user's gestures with the character's gestures, wear a full tracker, not just a normal headgear. It also adds additional sensors to the VR machine that can detect the biological rhythm and heartbeat. Use this device as an input device in the VR world. And if user installs all-round treadmill, he will be able to enjoy the game more lively.</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>&nbsp; Of course, VR games have not been widely commercialized yet. And it is definitely difficult to integrate VR game technology with the technology used in MMORPG. But I think this has the potential to be fully developed within five years. If this is realized, game users will play the game as long as they consider their physical condition. This has a positive effect not only to prevent game addiction but also to take care of their health. I'm going to look forward to seeing this happen.﻿<br></p>
