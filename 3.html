     <div style="margin-right: 5%; line-height: 3;"><p style="text-align: justify;"> &nbsp; The job is a game programmer, requiring proficiency in software design for game development and in high-level code quality, stability and maintenance. It also values advice and communication to cooperate with other developers, and develops new game ideas to evaluate whether they are suitable for the market.&nbsp;</p></div>
     <br><br>
     <div style="margin-right: 5%; line-height: 3;"><p style="text-align: justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, I was so ignorant that I didn't even know the 'G' of the game. Because I didn't usually do it at all. After finishing the college entrance exam, I had too much time, so I went to the PC room and played games with my friends for the first time. As the frequency of visits increased, interest in games grew. So I thought that I would like to be a game developer in the future. I have a lot of passion for a game programmer so that all the project ideas that I'm going to talking about on the next page are also about games.</p>
     <br><br>
     <div style="margin-right: 5%; line-height: 3;"><p style="text-align: justify;"> &nbsp;  This requires more than five powerful experiences for C# and UNITY3D games targeted at PC platforms. They also need to know how to write DLL files with C++, and experience writing APIs, servers, Windows services, console programs, Powershell/batch scripts, or websites. And also it needs experience working as a team using a version control system like Git, and help the team by utilizing the ability to work productively and autonomously. And basically, people have to be good at communicating with others in English.</p>
     <br><br>
     <div style="margin-right: 5%; line-height: 3;"><p style="text-align: justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; I have no skills or experience so far. However, it is believed that through this project, I will be able to experience more based on simple learning of HTML and GIT usage. Also, as this job requires additional VR experience, I want to study the details through the fifth week of classes. And with self-study, I will study C# and C++ based on C language to lay the foundation for becoming a game programmer.</p></div></td></tr></tbody>
